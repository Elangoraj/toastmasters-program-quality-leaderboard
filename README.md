# Toastmasters Program Quality Leaderboard
# Objective

To inspire leaders at the district, division, area, and club levels to strive for club quality and leadership development. This is achieved by influencing various levels to foster the overall educational growth of club members. Outcomes will be measured regularly, and clubs will be incentivized to make further quality improvements.

# Incentives Lifecycle

- Incentives will run on a **quarterly** basis.
- Clubs will be **nudged monthly** and leaderboards will be **updated monthly**.
- Points reset at the start of every quarter, and incentives are awarded to the top _n_ clubs.
- A **global leaderboard** will be displayed across all club groups.

# Club Groupings

To ensure fairness and equality in our incentive programs, clubs are segmented into four groups based on their size. This approach allows every club—regardless of membership count—to compete on a level playing field, receive recognition tailored to their context, and pursue excellence alongside similar peers. Grouping clubs this way celebrates diverse strengths and fosters an inclusive, motivating environment for all.

| Group    | Club Size      | Name             | Description                                       |
|----------|---------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Group 1  | Fewer than 12 | Spark Clubs      | Small but full of potential, these clubs are just igniting. |
| Group 2  | 12–20         | Rising Stars     | Gaining traction, these clubs are building energy and cohesion. |
| Group 3  | 21–40         | Powerhouse Clubs | Well-established, these clubs thrive on teamwork and synergy. |
| Group 4  | 41–100        | Pinnacle Clubs   | Large, vibrant clubs at the peak of influence and activity. |
