# **Incentives Program**

## **Introduction**

Welcome to the Club Incentives Program\! This guide is designed to help club officers understand how your club can excel by participating in a fair, engaging, and motivating program tailored to different club sizes and progress levels. Following this roadmap will boost club quality, member engagement, and leadership development while maximizing points and recognition.

---

## **Program Overview**

Program Quality Incentives motivates Toastmasters clubs to improve quality and leadership through a quarterly incentive system, with monthly leaderboards and nudges. Clubs are grouped by member size for fairness, and achievements are tracked across three tiers: educational progress, officer training/innovation, and club operations. Incentives reward milestones like Pathways completions, officer training, contests, and strategic planning.

Your club’s progress is measured through **three achievement tiers**, each focusing on crucial aspects of club development:

| Tier | Focus Area |
| ----- | ----- |
| Pathways Pioneers | Educational Progress (Pathways levels, DTM, Awards) |
| Leadership Innovators | Officer Training & Club Innovation |
| Excellence Champions | Club Operations & Planning (Success Plan, Admin Milestones) |

Each tier consists of specific goals clubs can complete to earn points and eventually district-level recognition and cash incentives awards towards room hire or zoom hire or purchase in TI Store.

## **Club Grouping by Size \- Ensuring Fairness and Equality**

To guarantee **fair competition and equal opportunity** for all clubs regardless of size, clubs are classified into four groups:

| Group | Club Size | Group Name | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Group 1 | Fewer than 16 | Spark Clubs | Small but full of potential, these clubs are just igniting. |
| Group 2 | 17–24 Members | Rising Stars | Gaining traction, these clubs are building energy and cohesion. |
| Group 3 | 25–40 Members | Powerhouse Clubs | Well-established, these clubs thrive on teamwork and synergy. |
| Group 4 | More than 41 Members | Pinnacle Clubs | Large, vibrant clubs at the peak of influence and activity. |

This grouping fosters fairness and encourages clubs to “level up” sustainably.
